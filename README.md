# Overview

The software is used by opening the web application and viewing the different places in the area. The buttons at the top can be clicked to filter different pins on the map. Each point on the map can be clicked to provide a name of the place and its address.

I used this software to demonstrate how to use ArcGIS. There are a lot of golf courses in the area, and I was showing them in comparison to other places, such as climbing gyms, hospitals, and colleges/universities.

# Development Environment

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to use ArcGIS information. I wrote the project in VS Code. Map data is pulled from ArcGIS, but the individual points are added using script through HTML.
